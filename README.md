# My Debian Setup

I am Raja, an Infrastrcuture automation engineer. 
I am a distro-hopper but always fallback to Debian due to its stability. 
But the process of setup, I am tired of it. 
So the usual steps I do I setup them as a shell script. 

Right now, I am keeping all files in Github, the download size may be > 400 MB and dont panic. 

Currently this setup does below things
- [x] Installing basic packages
- [x] Installing Google Chrome.
- [x] Enabling and starting
    - [x] tlp
    - [x] ufw
    - [x] podman
- [x] VIM Setup ( this is mostly my VIM but inspired from all the great developers, it may not be great but works for me :D)
- [x] Font Setup 
- [x] XFCE Terminal themes
- [] Downloading fonts from repo, to keep repo download size minimal
- [] checking if fonts already installed, if yes then skipping. 
- [] installing terminal themes only if XFCE Terminal installed. 
- [] Coc.nvim packages installation from inside of VIM. 




For now atleast these are the items, I am thinking. 
If you like this and would like to improve it, please feel free to fork it. 

Hope it helps you saving sometime.


Thank you.
